NAME
	crypt - hash a password string

SYNOPSIS
	string crypt(string data, string salt, int generate|void)

DESCRIPTION
	This function encrypts the given `data' using the given encryption
	`salt'. By default a number of random salt chars will be appended to
        the provided salt. This behaviour can be configured by providing the
        optional third argument with the number of chars to append.

        Which hash methods are available depends on the underlying OS.

        ID  -  Method
        1   | MD5
        2a  | Blowfish (not in mainline glibc; added in some
            | Linux distributions)

        5   | SHA-256 (since glibc 2.7)
        6   | SHA-512 (since glibc 2.7)
NOTE
        Access to this should be restricted through the valid_crypt callback
        in the master object as some methods have a very long execute time.

EXAMPLES
        crypt("foo", "$1$")  - Will return the foo hashed with a random salt
                               value using the MD5 algorithm (not recommended)

        crypt("foo", "$2b$06$", 22) - Will hash foo with bcrypt with 22 chars of
                                      salt
