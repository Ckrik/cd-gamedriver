NAME
	notify_fail - give a message to be printed if all commands failed

SYNOPSIS
	void notify_fail(string message, void|int priority)

DESCRIPTION
	With this function you can set a message that will be printed instead
	of the notorious 'What ?' when all commands fail. The message will be
	passed through process_string which allows you to decide the
	content of the string 'late' and also do other things in the
	function(s) called through process_string.

	If you set 'priority' to 0 (zero) then the previous default failure
	message set, if any, will not be over-written and 'message'
	will be discarded in favour of the message already assigned.
