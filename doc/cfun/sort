NAME
	sort - sort an array through a specific sort function

SYNOPSIS
	mixed *sort(mixed *array, void|function sortfunc)

DESCRIPTION
	Sort the array 'array' through the function 'sortfunc' and
	return the resulting array.  If you do not specify 'sortfunc'
	then it will try to do a logical sort on 'array' based on type.

	Strings in alphabetical order, ints in lowest-highest order, etc.

NOTES
	This is actually a CFUN and needs to be activated within the lib
	before it can be used.

EXAMPLE
	varargs mixed
	sort(mixed arr, function lfunc) = "sort";
