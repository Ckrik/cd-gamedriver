NAME
	write - write data (normally text) to the current player

SYNOPSIS
	void write(mixed data)

DESCRIPTION
	Writes data to the current 'command giver', ie the object returned
	by this_player(). Data is normally text.

NOTA BENE
	Write sends unprocessed messages to the recieving object.
	If the mudlib uses processing on messages then calling this
	function will send a raw message.
NOTES
	This is actually a CFUN and must be activated within the mudlib
	before it can be used.

EXAMPLE
	void
	write(mixed data) = "write";

SEE ALSO
	this_player, set_this_player, this_interactive
