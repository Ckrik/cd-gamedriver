Documentation of the driver callback hooks with examples of how
they might be implemented in the master object inside the mudlib.

The callback functions are named in master.n and are converted into
M_* named defines that you should use within the driver.  Use apply_master()
to call the master object with the M_* defines.  If you do not have a
function declared within the master object, 0 will be returned.

You must push the arguments you wish to use onto the stack and specify the
number of arguments to use in the apply.  Scan interpret.c for examples on
how to use driver callbacks in your driver code.

The documentation is thus far incomplete.
